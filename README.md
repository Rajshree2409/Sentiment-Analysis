# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. It classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral, and can also identify specific emotions like anger, joy, sadness, or surprise.

# Project Overview
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 -> Thorough exploration and visualization of the dataset to uncover underlying patterns and insights.

* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
-> Utilization of NLTK for fundamental sentiment analysis tasks, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and initial sentiment scoring.

* VADER Sentiment Analysis
Application of VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool optimized for social media text.

* Visualization of VADER Results
Graphical representation of sentiment scores derived from the VADER model to illustrate sentiment distribution within the dataset.

* RoBERTa Pretrained Model
Employment of the RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) transformer model for advanced sentiment analysis. This model leverages a large corpus of pre-trained data to understand word context within sentences.

* Model Performance Comparison
Comparative analysis of sentiment scores obtained from VADER and RoBERTa models to evaluate and contrast their effectiveness.

* Integration and Comparison of Models
Synthesis of results from various models to enhance the robustness of sentiment analysis.

* Review Analysis
Detailed examination of specific review examples, such as positive 1-star reviews and negative 5-star reviews, to explore sentiment nuances.

* Transformers Pipeline Development
Construction of an efficient pipeline using the transformers library to streamline and expedite sentiment prediction tasks.
